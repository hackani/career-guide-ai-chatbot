## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/career-guide.git
cd career-guide
```

2. Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

```

You can obtain a Hugging Face token at [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

## How It Works

The application uses:

- Next.js 15 for the frontend and API routes
- Hugging Face's Mixtral-8x7B model for generating career advice
- Streaming responses for a better user experience
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Markdown for formatting AI responses

The AI model analyzes user input about their interests, skills, and education to provide tailored career suggestions with detailed information about job prospects, required skills, and work-life balance.

## Customization

You can customize the career knowledge base by editing the `careerDomains` array in `app/api/chat/route.ts` to add more fields, tags, and job descriptions.
